I want you to create a **weekly meal plan** for 6 people that includes **4 healthy, balanced dishes**. Each dish should include:

- A clear name
- Main protein
- Key vegetables
- Optional grains or sides
- Brief description of why it’s healthy

I will provide a **JSON file containing deals** with prices and items. You must **prioritize using items from the JSON deals** where possible to **minimize cost**, while keeping the meals healthy and balanced.

Please also produce a **consolidated ingredient list** for all 4 dishes. For each ingredient, indicate:

- Name
- Quantity needed (approximate for 6 servings)
- If it’s included in the deals JSON (yes/no)

Output format should be **JSON** with this structure:

```json
{
  "meals": [
      {
        "dish_name": "",
        "description": "",
        "total_time": 0,
        "ingredients": [],
        "recipe": [
          "step1", "step2", ...
        ]
      },
      ...
  ],
  "ingredient_list": [
      {
        "ingredient": "",
        "quantity": "",
        "in_deals": "yes/no"
      },
      ...
  ]
}
```

**Constraints:**

- Only 4 dishes per week
- Each dish must feed 6 people
- Include a mix of proteins (meat, seafood, or plant-based)
- Minimize cost using the JSON deals
- Keep dishes healthy (high protein, fiber, vitamins; moderate carbs; low added sugars)
